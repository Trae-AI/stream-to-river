# Overview
English | [中文](README_CN.md)

[Streams to River](https://sstr.trae.com.cn/) is an English learning application. The purpose of this product is to record, extract, and manage English words, sentences, and related contexts encountered in daily life, combined with the [Ebbinghaus Forgetting Curve](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forgetting_curve) for periodic learning and memorization.

During development, [TRAE](https://www.trae.ai) was extensively used for code development, debugging, annotation, and unit test writing. Through [Coze workflow](https://www.coze.com/), capabilities such as image-to-text, real-time chat, speech recognition, and word highlighting were quickly integrated.

## Project Introduction
### 1.1 Project Introduction and Background

Streams to River V2 is a word learning and language processing microservice system built on the [Hertz](https://github.com/cloudwego/hertz) and [Kitex](https://github.com/cloudwego/kitex) frameworks. 
The system provides a complete solution from API services to RPC implementation, including core functional modules such as user authentication, word management, review progress tracking, real-time chat, speech recognition, and image-to-text conversion, using MySQL and Redis for data storage and cache optimization.

The system is designed to provide users with a comprehensive language learning platform, enhancing learning effectiveness and user experience by combining traditional word learning methods with modern AI technology. 
The system supports features such as word addition, querying, tag management, review progress tracking, and intelligent chat, and integrates multimodal processing capabilities such as speech recognition and image-to-text conversion to provide users with richer and more convenient learning methods.

### 1.2 System Architecture

The system adopts a front-end and back-end separated microservice architecture, mainly divided into the following layers:

1. **API Service Layer**: Based on the Hertz framework, providing HTTP API interfaces to handle requests from the front-end
2. **RPC Service Layer**: Based on the Kitex framework, implementing business logic to handle requests from the API service layer
3. **Data Access Layer**: Including MySQL database and Redis cache, responsible for persistent storage and caching of data
4. **Intelligent Processing Layer**: Integrating large language models (LLM), speech recognition (ASR), and image-to-text functionality
